I performed multiple market searches to find comparable items:

${allResults.map((result, index) => `
Search ${index + 1} using term "${result.query}":
${JSON.stringify(result.data, null, 2)}
`).join('\n')}

Based on this market data, please provide a detailed justification or challenge of the proposed value.
Consider:
1. How the item's value compares to similar items in the market data
2. The progression from broad to specific searches (${searchTerms.join(' â†’ ')})
3. Which search provided the most relevant comparables and why
4. Any notable price patterns or trends across the different search results
5. Specific examples that support or challenge the valuation

If the market data is limited or not directly comparable, please:
- Explain why finding exact matches might be challenging
- Use the broader market context from similar categories
- Highlight what factors from the original item might justify price differences
- Suggest what additional information would help refine the valuation

Please provide your analysis in a clear, professional manner with specific references to the market data.`;
